# Planning_with_AI - Task Management Application

## Project Overview

A web-based task management application that allows users to create, organize, and track their tasks efficiently.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **AI Integration**: Qwen for code generation, testing, and API-aware functions

## Features

- User authentication (signup/login)
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Task categorization and due dates
- Progress tracking
- Responsive UI for all devices

## AI Integration Plan

### ðŸ§± Code or Feature Generation

Using AI to scaffold:

- React components for task UI
- Express routes for CRUD operations
- Mongoose models for data structure
- Authentication middleware

### ðŸ§ª Testing Support

AI-assisted generation of:

- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for database operations
- Frontend component tests
- Edge case scenario testing

### ðŸ“¡ Schema-Aware Generation

Leveraging REST API specifications to:

- Generate API client functions
- Create validation schemas
- Build OpenAPI documentation
- Auto-generate CRUD operations

### In-Editor Tooling

- **Tool**: Qoder IDE with AI capabilities
- **Support**:
  - Intelligent code completion
  - Automated code review
  - Commit message generation
  - PR summary creation

## Sample AI Prompts

1. "Generate a React component for a task creation form with fields for title, description, due date, and category, using TypeScript interfaces"
2. "Create unit tests for the task creation API endpoint that validate input fields, check database insertion, and verify response formats"
